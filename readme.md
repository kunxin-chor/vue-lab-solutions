# Setup

If using your own computer, make sure **Vue CLI** is installed:
```
yarn install
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

# Login
In the `vue-testing` directory, type in `node login.js`

# To run the test case
In the `vue-testing` directory, type in `node run-test <test-directroy>`, where `<test-directory>` is the question that you want to test. For example, to test `q01-01`, type in: `node run-test q01-01`.

## Important
If you are running the test cases in Windows, ignore the `ELIFECYCLE` error message if your test case does not pass.
