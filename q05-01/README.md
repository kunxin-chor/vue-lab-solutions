## Question
There's a textbox in the `<template>` of `App.vue`, and a data property named `input` defined in `App.vue` too.

Using `v-model`, make it such that whenever is typed into the textbox is stored in the `input` data property. Display the value of `input` inside the `<span>` with the id of `display`
