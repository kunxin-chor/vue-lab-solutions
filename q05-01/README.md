## Question
There's a textbox in the `<template>` of `App.vue`, and a data property named `input` defined in `App.vue` too.

Using `v-model`, make it such that whenever is typed into the textbox is stored in the `input` data property. Display the value of `input` inside the `<span>` with the id of `display`

## Question
There is one button, one labeled as `Apple`. There is also one `<div>`, showing the word Apple. 

Using `v-if`, display the Apple `<div>` when the Apple button is clicked. The Apple `<div>` should not be displayed when the Vue app first starts.

Hint: examine the `v-on` code for the the buttons carefully.
