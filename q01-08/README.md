## Question
In this execrise, you get to create a counter. There is a `<div>` with the id of `counter`, and two
buttons, with the id of `increment` and `decrement` respectively.
Complete the following tasks:
1. Create a data property named `count` and set its initial value to 0
2. Display the `count` data property inside `<div#counter>`
3. Add event listener to the `Increment` button so that when it is clicked, increase the `count` data property by 1
4. Add event listener to the `Decrement` button so that when it is clicked, increase the `count` data property by 1
5. Make sure that the `count` data property does not go beyond 10 and go below -10.
