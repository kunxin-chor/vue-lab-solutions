# q01-04: Using the `v-if` directives

## Question
There is one button, one labeled as `Apple`. There is also one `<div>`, showing the word Apple. 

Using `v-if`, display the Apple `<div>` when the Apple button is clicked. The Apple `<div>` should not be displayed when the Vue app first starts.

Hint: examine the `v-on` code for the the buttons carefully.
