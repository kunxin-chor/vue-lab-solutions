# q01-04: Using the `v-if` directives

## Question
There are two buttons, one labeled as `Apple` and the other labeled `Orange`. There are also two `<div>`, one showing the word Apple  and the other one the word Orange. 

Using `v-if`, display the Apple `<div>` if the Apple button is clicked, and the orange `<div>` if the orange button is clicked.

Hint: examine the `v-on` code for the two buttons carefully.
